                            "Happiness pertains to a state of wellness characterized by a spectrum of emotions spanning from profound contentment to exuberant gladness and delight. It encompasses feelings of pleasure, gratitude, satisfaction, joy, and more. Psychologists delineate happiness as a sensation rooted in positive emotions like joy, interest, pride, life satisfaction, and an appreciation of moments. In July 2011, the United Nations General Assembly initiated a movement, urging nations to engage in assessing their citizens' happiness and employing this data to inform public policies. The inaugural World Happiness Report was unveiled the subsequent year, capturing international attention from all participating nations. Subsequently, an annual report on national happiness has been published each year. This serves as a fundamental framework for governments and national leaders to explore, facilitating a study that offers insights into the status of happiness within a country. This, in turn, can empower governments to advance and enhance their overall national well-being. Numerous government officials have been harnessing the potential of this data through meticulous analysis to elevate their respective countries. The World Happiness Report has assisted each country in identifying the contributing factors to happiness. This research yields substantial value and significant insights that aid governmental leaders in making critical decisions. By visualizing data-driven factors for each nation, this study provides a foundation for pinpointing the elements that genuinely influence a country's happiness score. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly has been consistently publishing annual reports that are available for download. These reports provide an overview of the Happiness Score based on six key metrics: Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust, and Generosity. These assessments are meticulously crafted with input from experts across various fields, including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, ensuring the accurate measurement of well-being within nations. Each report is structured from a macro to micro perspective, discussing topics such as happiness, mental health, satisfaction, and ethics. The data used for these reports are gathered from sources like the Gallup World Poll Questionnaire and the World Values Survey , which cover diverse areas of interest.

Various factors contribute to the formation of a happy society. Personal experiences of happiness might stem from receiving gifts, engaging in charitable acts, active participation in society, positive thoughts about friends and family, contentment, and robust social and professional connections. Elements such as good physical and mental health, strong relationships, an appreciation for art and nature, satisfactory living standards, and effective coping mechanisms are outlined by Forbes as crucial aspects of a happy society.

Environmental conditions, including season, weather, and temperature, also influence societal happiness. Research based on datasets from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) suggests a positive correlation between average weather variables and happiness, alongside economic factors. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg's two-factor theory emphasizes that workplace happiness extends beyond individual recognition and includes factors like company policies, working conditions, wages, and benefits.

Studies have not only explored the components of a happy society but also delved into the factors that contribute to individual happiness. Inner thoughts about others, self-acceptance, lifestyle, and positive activities are linked to personal happiness. Giving to others has also been associated with increased happiness, particularly when the act of giving is voluntary, connected, and impactful. Migration to more developed regions has been found to generally increase happiness. Moreover, research has explored the correlation between mobile phone and internet usage and personal happiness, suggesting a significant relationship.

In a broader sense, maintaining a happy nation is intertwined with various factors discussed above. A nation's development is influenced by the collective health and longevity of its citizens. Economic differences can impact happiness levels, and well-being promotion has become a goal for governments. Technical governance quality and effective policies contribute to a higher level of national happiness. Citizens' understanding of well-being measurements and their selection of supportive politicians can make a substantial difference in a nation's overall well-being.

In summary, this literature review encompasses a comprehensive examination of the factors contributing to individual and societal happiness. It underscores the role of environmental conditions, personal attributes, social connections, governance quality, and even technological advancements in shaping happiness at both individual and national levels.
